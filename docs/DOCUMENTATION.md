# OpenAce-Rust Documentation


## Introduction and Motivation

OpenAce is an open, high-performance P2P streaming platform developed from scratch in Rust. Since Ace Stream is proprietary and closed-source, we are building a free alternative that embodies the spirit of the open internet. Our motivation is to create a platform accessible to everyone – developers, content creators, and users who value freedom, privacy, and community.

Rust enables a modern, secure, and efficient implementation with features like memory safety, asynchronous processing, and high performance. OpenAce offers advanced P2P streaming capabilities, hardware acceleration, modular engines, and seamless integration into existing systems. It is highly performant through optimized algorithms, lock-free structures where appropriate, and hardware-specific optimizations, making it ideal for real-time streaming.

A central goal is to achieve high interoperability with the Ace Stream ecosystem for smooth integration and migration, based on public interfaces and documentation.

- Replace any remaining `.lock()` calls on `SafeMutex` with `.lock().await`.
- If you need synchronous condition variables, prefer `SafeCondvar` with `parking_lot::Mutex` guards; for async workflows, use channels or `Notify`.

## Follow-ups

- Consider making the chat history TTL configurable via `LiveConfig`.
- Audit for any remaining blocking primitives on async paths.

## Transport Engine Tasks

- `TransportEngine::initialize()` spawns two async tasks operating on a task-cloned view `TransportEngineTask`:
  - `message_processing_loop(rx, shutdown)` handles queued `TransportMessage`s via TCP/UDP handlers and updates per-connection stats.
  - `connection_monitoring_loop()` periodically calls `monitor_connections()` to close idle connections (>5 minutes).
- The task type implements the same logic as the engine methods but works on `Arc<RwLock<...>>` clones returned by `SafeRwLock::inner()`.

## Error Handling

- Replaced non-existent `OpenAceError::transport(...)` with `OpenAceError::engine_operation("transport", operation, message)`.

## Logging

- Subscriber layering simplified to `tracing_subscriber::registry().with(console).with(file|sink).with(perf).init()`.
- File logging uses `tracing_appender::rolling::daily` with non-blocking writer; when no file is configured, a sink writer avoids code branching.
- Performance layer is present but filtered to `off` when tracing is disabled in config.

## Build & Features

- Logging target fields: when you need dynamic targets, prefer structured fields with `tracing::event!(Level::X, log_target = %target, ...)` instead of `target: some_string`. This avoids compile-time constraints on `target` literals.

## Enhanced Debug Logging

### Overview
All engine modules now implement comprehensive debug logging for system monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance analysis. The logging implementation follows a structured approach with appropriate log levels for different types of information.

### Log Level Strategy
- **TRACE**: Fine-grained execution flow and state transitions
- **DEBUG**: Detailed operational information, statistics updates, and internal state changes
- **INFO**: Important operational events, successful completions, and milestone achievements
- **WARN**: Non-critical issues that don't affect functionality
- **ERROR**: Critical errors, invalid states, and operation failures

### Engine-Specific Logging

#### Segmenter Engine
- **Initialization**: State transitions, channel setup, background task spawning
- **Job Submission**: Job creation, validation, queue management, statistics updates
- **Statistics Tracking**: Before/after values for job counts, processing times, and queue sizes
- **Error Handling**: Invalid states, job validation failures, queue operation errors

#### Main Engine
- **Initialization**: Component setup, communication channels, management task startup
- **State Management**: Transitions between Ready/Running states with detailed context
- **Statistics Updates**: `uptime_ms` tracking with precise timing information
- **Component Lifecycle**: Individual engine component initialization and health monitoring

#### Live Engine
- **Initialization**: Channel setup, background task spawning (monitoring, chat cleanup)
- **Broadcast Management**: Creation, configuration, stream key generation, storage
- **Statistics Tracking**: Broadcast counts, viewer metrics, chat message statistics
- **Background Tasks**: Monitoring loop status, chat cleanup operations

#### Transport Engine
- **Connection Management**: Creation, validation, state transitions, cleanup
- **Message Processing**: Queuing, validation, sending, statistics updates
- **Network Operations**: Protocol handling, connection monitoring, error recovery
- **Performance Metrics**: Bandwidth, latency, throughput, and connection statistics

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Structured Logging
```rust
// Use structured fields for better searchability
debug!("Statistics updated: total_jobs {} -> {}, active_jobs {} -> {}", 
       prev_total, stats.total_jobs, prev_active, stats.active_jobs);

// Include relevant context in log messages
trace!("State transition: {:?} -> {:?} (reason: {})", old_state, new_state, reason);
```

## Central Logging Infrastructure

### Overview
The OpenAce-Rust project implements a sophisticated central logging infrastructure that efficiently collects, processes, and analyzes logs from all engine components. This system provides real-time log aggregation, statistical analysis, and health monitoring capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking log collection using Tokio channels
- **Structured Logging**: Rich metadata and correlation ID support
- **Statistical Analysis**: Real-time metrics and trend analysis
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic health status determination based on log patterns
- **Memory Management**: Configurable log rotation and retention
- **Search Capabilities**: Full-text search and filtering by component/level

### Usage

#### Initialization
```rust
use openace_rust::core::logging::{initialize_logging, LogLevel};

// Initialize with 10,000 max entries and Info minimum level
initialize_logging(10000, LogLevel::Info).await?;
```

#### Logging with Convenience Macros
```rust
use openace_rust::{central_error, central_warn, central_info, central_debug};

// Log different levels
central_error!("engine", "Failed to process stream: {}", error_msg);
central_warn!("transport", "High latency detected: {}ms", latency);
central_info!("segmenter", "Segment created: {}", segment_id);
central_debug!("live", "Processing frame {}", frame_number);
```

#### Health Monitoring
```rust
if let Some(manager) = get_log_manager().await {
    let health = manager.get_health_status().await;
    match health.level {
        LogHealthLevel::Healthy => println!("System is healthy"),
        LogHealthLevel::Warning => println!("System has warnings"),
        LogHealthLevel::Critical => println!("System is in critical state"),
    }
}
```

#### Statistics and Analysis
```rust
if let Some(manager) = get_log_manager().await {
    let stats = manager.get_statistics().await;
    println!("Total entries: {}", stats.total_entries);
    println!("Error rate: {:.2}%", stats.error_rate * 100.0);
    println!("Peak log rate: {} logs/sec", stats.peak_log_rate);
    
    // Search and filter logs
    let errors = manager.get_entries_by_level(LogLevel::Error).await;
    let engine_logs = manager.get_entries_by_component("engine").await;
    let search_results = manager.search_entries("failed").await;
}
```

### Health Status Calculation
- **Healthy**: Error rate < 5%, Warning rate < 20%
- **Warning**: Error rate 5-10% OR Warning rate > 20%
- **Critical**: Error rate > 10%

### Performance Characteristics
- **Log Submission**: < 1μs (channel send)
- **Statistics Update**: < 100μs per entry
- **Memory Bounded**: Configurable memory usage limits with automatic rotation

### Integration Example
```rust
impl MainEngine {
    pub async fn start(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        central_info!("main_engine", "Starting main engine");
        
        match self.initialize().await {
            Ok(_) => {
                central_info!("main_engine", "Main engine started successfully");
                Ok(())
            }
            Err(e) => {
                central_error!("main_engine", "Failed to start main engine: {}", e);
                Err(e)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For detailed documentation, see [CENTRAL_LOGGING.md](CENTRAL_LOGGING.md).

#### Performance Considerations
- Debug logging is designed to have minimal performance impact
- Expensive operations (like formatting) are only performed when the log level is enabled
- Statistics updates are logged with before/after values for precise tracking

#### Error Context
- All error conditions include sufficient context for debugging
- State validation errors include current and expected states
- Operation failures include relevant identifiers and parameters

### Usage Examples

#### Enabling Debug Logging
```rust
// Set log level in configuration
use tracing::Level;
use tracing_subscriber::FmtSubscriber;

let subscriber = FmtSubscriber::builder()
    .with_max_level(Level::DEBUG)
    .finish();

tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber)?;
```

#### Filtering by Engine
```bash
# Environment variable filtering
RUST_LOG="openace::engines::segmenter=debug,openace::engines::live=info" ./openace
```

### Monitoring and Analysis
The enhanced logging provides visibility into:
- System performance bottlenecks
- Resource allocation patterns
- Error frequency and types
- State transition timing
- Background task health
- Statistics evolution over time

This comprehensive logging infrastructure enables effective debugging, performance optimization, and system monitoring in production environments.

             health.last_error.unwrap_or_default());
}
```

#### Searching and Filtering
```rust
// Search by text
let results = aggregator.search("error", None, None).await?;

    engine: Some("transport".to_string()),
    level: Some(LogLevel::Error),
    start_time: Some(Utc::now() - Duration::hours(1)),
    end_time: Some(Utc::now()),
};

let filtered_logs = aggregator.get_filtered_logs(filter).await?;
```

### Configuration Parameters

#### LogConfig Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct LogConfig {
    /// Maximum number of log entries to retain

impl SegmenterEngine {
    async fn process_segment(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), EngineError> {
        self.log_aggregator.log(
            LogLevel::Debug,
            "segmenter",
            &format!("Processing segment of {} bytes", data.len()),
            None
        ).await?;
        
        // Processing logic...
        
        self.log_aggregator.log(
            LogLevel::Info,
            "segmenter",
            "Segment processing completed successfully",
            None
        ).await?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Testing Infrastructure

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Throughput and latency benchmarks
- **Memory Tests**: Memory usage and leak detection
- **Concurrency Tests**: Thread safety validation

### Future Enhancements

#### Planned Features
- **Log shipping**: Remote log aggregation
- **Alerting**: Configurable alert conditions
- **Dashboards**: Real-time monitoring interfaces
- **Log analysis**: Advanced pattern detection
- **Compression**: Log data compression for storage efficiency

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce `max_entries` or `max_memory_mb`
   - Enable log rotation
   - Check for log level misconfiguration

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Disable statistics if not needed
   - Increase buffer sizes
   - Reduce log verbosity

3. **Missing Logs**
   - Check log level configuration
   - Verify engine name filtering
   - Ensure proper initialization

#### Diagnostic Commands
```rust
// Check system health
let health = aggregator.get_health_status().await;
if !health.is_healthy {
    println!("System unhealthy: {:?}", health);
}

// Monitor memory usage
let stats = aggregator.get_statistics().await;
if stats.memory_usage_bytes > (50 * 1024 * 1024) {
    println!("High memory usage: {} MB", 
             stats.memory_usage_bytes / (1024 * 1024));
}
```

## MainEngine Architecture

- **Focused Responsibility**: MainEngine now exclusively manages the main configuration section (`MainConfig`) rather than the entire system configuration.
- **Type Safety**: All MainEngine methods now work with `&MainConfig` parameters, ensuring type consistency and preventing access to configuration sections that don't belong to the main engine.
- **Configuration Management**:
  - `MainEngine::new(&MainConfig)` - Creates engine instance with main configuration
  - `update_config(&MainConfig)` - Updates only the main configuration section
  - `validate_config(&MainConfig)` - Validates main-specific fields (enabled, max_concurrent_streams, content_cache_size_mb, discovery_timeout_seconds, max_content_size_mb)
- **Simplified Initialization**: MainEngine no longer initializes other engines (segmenter, streamer, transport, live). These are managed independently by EngineManager.
- **Component Restart**: MainEngine delegates component restart operations to EngineManager, maintaining clear separation of concerns.
- **Task Management**: MainEngineTask and EngineCommand consistently use MainConfig throughout the async task system.
- **Test Infrastructure**: All test cases have been updated to properly initialize dependencies:
  - `GlobalContext::new()` calls now include required `Config` parameter
  - `DataBuffer::new()` test cases properly handle byte array references
  - All 55 tests pass successfully with zero compilation errors
- **Build Status**: The codebase now compiles cleanly with zero warnings and all tests pass, confirming the architectural changes maintain system integrity while improving type safety.

## Engine Separation

- **MainEngine**: Core configuration and main engine functionality
- **SegmenterEngine**: Media segmentation with SegmenterConfig
- **StreamerEngine**: Streaming operations with StreamerConfig  
- **TransportEngine**: Network transport with TransportConfig
- **LiveEngine**: Live streaming features with LiveConfig
- **EngineManager**: Orchestrates all engines and handles cross-engine operations

This modular architecture ensures each engine has clear boundaries and responsibilities, improving maintainability and type safety.

## Current Status

The Rust implementation is **NOT PRODUCTION READY** and lacks **100% compatibility** with the Ace Stream ecosystem. A comprehensive compatibility assessment has been completed, confirming the following implementations already working:

### Completed Components
- ✅ Main Engine with integrated CoreEngine and CoreApp functionality
- ✅ Live Engine with async streaming capabilities
- ✅ Transport Engine with P2P networking
- ✅ Streamer Engine with hardware acceleration support
- ✅ Segmenter Engine with media processing
- ✅ Engine Manager for coordination
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Type-safe configuration management
- ✅ Thread-safe operations with SafeMutex

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Fully implemented across all engine modules with comprehensive tracing
- ✅ **Central Logging Infrastructure**: Complete with statistical analysis and health monitoring
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and performance tests
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and architectural guides
- ✅ **Build System**: Clean compilation with zero warnings and optimized performance
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Build System**: Multi-platform binary generation with automated build pipeline

- Encoding: `ISO-8859-1` is treated as `WINDOWS-1252` (WHATWG compatibility). The `encoding_rs` crate is used; do not rely on a non-existent `ISO_8859_1` constant.
- Cargo features: default features are now empty. Python bindings are optional behind `--features python`. Minimal stub exists at `src/python.rs`.

## Advanced System Management

### Enhanced Error Handling (`src/error.rs`, `src/error_recovery.rs`)

#### Comprehensive Error Context
- **Error Severity Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info for proper error prioritization
- **Rich Error Context**: Detailed context information including component, operation, timestamp, and metadata
- **Recovery Strategies**: Automatic retry, restart component, graceful degradation, manual intervention, ignore
- **Error Categories**: Memory allocation, thread safety, engine initialization, network, file I/O, configuration, resource exhaustion, timeout, validation, state management, hardware acceleration, streaming protocol, chat system, metrics collection

#### Automatic Error Recovery System
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures with configurable failure thresholds
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
- **Recovery Tracking**: Comprehensive statistics on recovery attempts and success rates
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic recovery triggers
- **Recovery Policies**: Configurable policies for different error types and components

```rust
// Example: Creating an error with context and recovery strategy
let error = OpenAceError::network_with_context(
    "Connection timeout",
    ErrorContext::new("transport_engine", "establish_connection")
        .with_metadata("peer_id", peer_id)
        .with_metadata("timeout_ms", "5000"),
    RecoveryStrategy::Retry { max_attempts: 3, backoff_ms: 1000 }
);
```

### State Management System (`src/state_management.rs`)

#### Centralized State Control
- **State Synchronization**: Thread-safe state management with atomic operations
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive validation rules for state transitions
- **State Persistence**: Automatic state persistence with configurable intervals
- **Conflict Resolution**: Advanced conflict resolution strategies for concurrent state changes
- **Event Notifications**: Real-time state change notifications with filtering
- **State History**: Complete audit trail of state changes with rollback capabilities

#### State Management Features
- **Atomic State Updates**: Ensures consistency across concurrent operations
- **State Snapshots**: Point-in-time state capture for backup and analysis
- **State Validation Rules**: Configurable validation logic for state transitions
- **Event Broadcasting**: Publish-subscribe pattern for state change notifications
- **Persistence Strategies**: Multiple persistence backends (memory, file, database)

```rust
// Example: Managing engine state with validation
let mut state_manager = StateManager::new();
state_manager.set_validation_rule("engine_state", |old, new| {
    // Custom validation logic
    matches!((old, new), (EngineState::Ready, EngineState::Running))
});
```

### Resource Management System (`src/resource_management.rs`)

#### Comprehensive Resource Lifecycle
- **Resource States**: Initializing, Active, Idle, Cleanup, Disposed, Error with automatic transitions
- **Priority Management**: High, Medium, Low priority levels for resource allocation
- **Usage Statistics**: Detailed tracking of resource utilization and performance metrics
- **Resource Pools**: Efficient pooling of reusable resources with automatic scaling
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic cleanup of unhealthy resources
- **Resource Handles**: Safe, reference-counted access to managed resources

#### Advanced Resource Features
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Background tasks for resource cleanup and optimization
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits on resource usage and allocation
- **Resource Events**: Real-time notifications for resource lifecycle events
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed metrics on resource performance and efficiency
- **Resource Dependencies**: Dependency tracking and coordinated lifecycle management

```rust
// Example: Managing a resource with automatic cleanup
let resource_manager = ResourceManager::new();
let handle = resource_manager.acquire_resource::<DatabaseConnection>(
    "db_connection",
    ResourcePriority::High,
    ResourceMetadata::new()
        .with_tag("database", "primary")
        .with_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
).await?;
```

#### Integration with Engine System
- **Engine Resource Management**: Each engine automatically manages its resources through the central system
- **Cross-Engine Resource Sharing**: Efficient sharing of resources between different engines
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of resource usage across all engines
- **Automatic Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on engine load and performance

### Optimized Hardware Acceleration for Streaming Engine

This subsection outlines the roadmap for implementing hardware-accelerated streaming, focusing on target devices, codecs, and optimizations for efficiency and performance.

**Target Devices**
   - Amlogic S905/S905X/W (A53) → Mali-450, GLES 2.0, no Vulkan
   - Amlogic S905X2/S905X3 (A55)/S905X4 (A55, AV1-HW) → Mali-G31 MP2, GLES 3.2, Vulkan possible
   - Rockchip RK3566/RK3568 (A55) → Mali-G52-2EE, GLES 3.2, Vulkan possible
   - Allwinner H616/H618 (A53) → Mali-G31 MP2, GLES 3.2, Vulkan possible
   - NVIDIA Tegra X1/X1+ (Shield TV) → Maxwell GPU, Vulkan 1.0/1.1
   - Apple Silicon (M-series: M1/M2/M3 …) → ARMv8-A, Apple GPU, Metal, VideoToolbox
   Note: Older SoCs (RK3328, RK3528, H5) → Mali-450 → GLES 2.0.

**Video Codecs**
   - Android: H.264, HEVC (H.265), VP9; AV1 where available (e.g., S905X4) → Runtime check.
   - Apple Silicon: H.264/HEVC; VP9/AV1 depending on chip/OS → Runtime check.
   - Rule: Prioritize VPU, fallback to software decode if unavailable.

**Graphics API & Render Paths**
   - Mali-450: GLES 2.0 (External Textures), no Vulkan.
   - Mali-G31/G52: Prefer Vulkan, fallback to GLES 3.x.
   - Tegra X1: Prefer Vulkan, fallback to GLES.
   - Apple Silicon: Metal with frames from VideoToolbox/IOSurface.

**SoC → Pipeline Mapping**
   - Mali-450 SoCs: VPU (MediaCodec) → GLES2 (OES) → Zero-Copy via Surface/Buffer.
   - G31/G52 SoCs: VPU (MediaCodec) → Vulkan/GLES3 → Zero-Copy via AHardwareBuffer/Surface.
   - Tegra X1/X1+: VPU → Vulkan → Zero-Copy.
   - Apple Silicon: VideoToolbox → Metal → Zero-Copy via CVPixelBuffer/IOSurface.

**Video Buffering & Zero-Copy**
   - Prioritize Zero-Copy: Decoder output directly as GPU texture/buffer.
   - Formats: YUV/NV12/NV21 as External Texture (Android) or CVPixelBuffer/IOSurface (macOS).
   - Pacing: VSYNC-bound; respect timestamps; controlled dropping.
   - Fallback: Maximum one copy if impossible.

**CPU Optimizations (AArch64)**
   - Base on NEON; vectorize hot loops (Copy/Blend, Checksums, FEC-XOR).
   - Use Crypto Extensions (AES/PMULL/SHA2) if available, else portable paths.
   - Runtime detection + dispatch.
   - Scheduling: Separate threads (Decode/Render/Timing), small queues, pool allocator.

**Decoder/VPU**
   - Prioritize HW Decoder; check capabilities (H.264/HEVC/VP9/AV1).
   - Hook frames Zero-Copy into renderer (Surface/Buffer Interop).

**Apple Silicon Specifics**
   - Decode: Prioritize VideoToolbox; check codecs.
   - Render: Metal with IOSurface/CVPixelBuffer (Zero-Copy).
   - Filters/Scaling on GPU; CPU only for control logic/timing.
   - SIMD: AArch64 principles (NEON, dispatch).

## Utilities Module Imports

- To avoid ambiguous glob re-exports, do not import `strings::*` or `time::*` via `utils::*`.
- Access utilities via qualified paths instead:
  - `use crate::utils::strings;` then `strings::formatting::to_snake_case(...)`.
  - `use crate::utils::time;` then `time::formatting::format_duration(...)`.
- This prevents collisions between submodules like `formatting`.
